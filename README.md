# -Health-Data-Cleaning-using-Excel-          
Making a raw data clean and ready for analysis    
This is a public health raw data set that came in with several inconsistencies, errors, missing and mixed up values  
I used several excel functions to extract, correct and reform the dataset correctly in order to achieve valid insights.  
Examples of things I did;  
. Find and replaced  
. Lower and upper case changes  
. Trim & Proper to removed spaces and rewrite texts in correct forms  
. Blanks -- filled empty cells  
. Iferror
